# Thank you for taking the time to visit my project! This program calls Reddit's praw API wrapper to pull information from
# a specific subreddit - in this case, the DBZ Dokkan Battle mobile game subreddit. You can use this program to search
# for posts that are flared with 'Global News', 'JPN News', or both to get the latest information about either version
# of the game. This is useful for people who don't want to scroll through hundreds of posts to see if there is anything
# new going on. You can choose by which parameter you want to search (i.e. new, hot, top posts, etc.) and how many 
# posts you actually want to search through.

# I would love to hear feedback from the community about my program!
